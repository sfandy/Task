Task
====

Project
-------
Task is an Android app designed to keep track of a person's day-to-day list
of things to do. Task only displays items that the user has added to their
to do list in the past 24 hours. Tasks can be added to the to do list from
one of two sources: completely new tasks, or from a list of expired or
completed tasks from the past 7 days.

Purpose
-------
I chose to build this app for a couple reasons. First, I needed a short
project I could complete in just a few weeks. Second, I wanted to learn more
about mobile development. As Java is my best language (and Android development
has fewer initial costs than iOS development), I chose to start out with an
Android app. Along the way, I've learned a lot about the Android SDK, how to
develop for multiple devices, the front-end technologies used by Android, and
how to pass information between activities and fragments. In the future I plan
on creating an iOS version of this application with a significantly upgraded
UI.
